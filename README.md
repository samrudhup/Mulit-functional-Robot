Multi-functional Robot for harvesting Areca nuts and spraying pesticides.This paper proposes a novel design and fabrication of a multifunctional robot for harvesting areca nuts and spraying pesticides. It provides an alternate for traditional manual method. The robot uses a kind of rack and pinion mechanism to move up and down the tree. The movement of the robot is controlled by using an aurdino circuit based remote control. It regulates the wheels of the robot through motors in which the rack is considered as the trunk of the tree and pinion is considered to be the wheels. It operates by using Double Pole Double Throw (DPDT) switch. The connectivity of the remote and motor is ensured by Bluetooth connection. Specific designed sprayer or a cutter are mounted on the frame of the robot for proper harvest of areca nut.
